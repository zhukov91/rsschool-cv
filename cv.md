### About me:
---
Good afternoon! I love working, and I like the dynamics of progress in programming. I am a person who likes perfectionism, so I try to do my job as efficiently as possible. I like programming, and I try to devote 2-3 hours to it every day.

I try to develop every day by pumping my skill. I hope that soon I will become a good programmer, because itâ€™s cool!

### Code Example:
---
Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.

Unfortunately, they have now left and the code they gave you doesn't work. Fix the helper function they wrote so that it works as intended (i.e. make the first character in the string "word" upper case).
```js
function capitalizeWord(word) {
 let firstLetter = word[0].toUpperCase();
  word = firstLetter + word.slice(1);
  return word;
}
```
