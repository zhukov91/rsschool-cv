# Summary:
Having tried programming, I liked it. I want to start my career as a junior front-end developer.
# About me:
Good afternoon! I love working, and I like the dynamics of progress in programming. I am a person who likes perfectionism, so I try to do my job as efficiently as possible. I like programming, and I try to devote 2-3 hours to it every day.

I try to develop every day by pumping my skill. I hope that soon I will become a good programmer, because it's cool!
